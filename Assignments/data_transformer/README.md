# User Data Transformer

This project demonstrates how to simulate fetching user data asynchronously and transform it using modern ES6+ JavaScript features such as Promises, async/await, arrow functions, and object destructuring.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Simulates API data fetching with setTimeout and Promise.

- Uses async/await for handling asynchronous operations.

- Applies .map() with destructuring to simplify user data.

- Returns a clean array with only relevant information.

### How to Run

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.

2. Run the script in your terminal:

```bash
node app.js
```

3. Youâ€™ll see the processed user data logged in the console.

```css
Example Output

  { name: 'Alex Architect', companyName: 'BuildCo' },
  { name: 'Jane Developer', companyName: 'CodeStream' },
  { name: 'Sam Designer', companyName: 'CreativeStudio' }
]
```
